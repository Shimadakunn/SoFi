# SocFiLend ðŸŒ±

SocFiLend is an DeFi overcollateralised lending protocol using on-chain social profiles (Lens, ENS, etc.) as collateral for borrowing assets.

Our appplication uses smart analytics to monitor blockchain activity, generating a reputation score for each user with an advanced social graph system. Depending on the reputation score obtained by the user, he is eligible to borrow an amount of assets. 

This project has been built during ETH Global Istanbul 2023 Hackathon. More information [here](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul).
